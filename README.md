Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews (Naive-Bayes Algorithm)
Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews (Naive-Bayes Algorithm) Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews using the Naive Bayes Algorithm involves applying machine learning techniques to automatically classify the sentiment expressed in product reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The Naive Bayes algorithm is particularly suitable for this task due to its simplicity and efficiency. It works by calculating the probability of a review belonging to each sentiment category based on the occurrence of words in the text. Despite its basic assumption of feature independence, Naive Bayes often yields satisfactory results in sentiment analysis tasks, making it a popular choice for analyzing product reviews at scale.
